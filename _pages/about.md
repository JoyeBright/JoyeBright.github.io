> I'm enthusiastically interested in Computer Science which its succinct definition is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. I personally distinguish from two different aspects. In the first, working on Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning and in the second one, Server Configuration and Web Development are my preferences.
I pursue to get the upper educational degrees in my major as well.

My research interests include:
 - [x] Natural Language Processing(NLP)
 - [x] Sentiment Analysis
 - [x] Deep Learning
 - [x] Machine Learning
 - [x] Data Mining
