> I'm enthusiastically interested in Computer Science which its succinct definition is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. I personally distinguish it from two different aspects. In the first, working on Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning and in the second one, Server Configuration and Web Development are my preferences.
