> Hi, my full name is Javad PourMostafa (pronounced /'dʒævɒd puːr'moʊs'tae'fɑː/)! I go by joeybright or joyebright wherever I can get the username. I'm currently a graduate member at [Guilan NLP Group](https://nlp.guilan.ac.ir){:target="new"} and a part-time lecturer at the Computer Engineering Department of the [University of Guilan](https://guilan.ac.ir/en/home){:target="new"}. I graduated with an MS degree in Software Engineering from the same university in 2019. During the master thesis, I worked on designing sentiment analysis models using deep learning architectures for low-resources corpora.

> My research interests mainly centralize on Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning. I'm also interested in AI more broadly; As to non-academic affairs, I spend my time on Unix-like servers maintenance. 

Some topics of interest to me are:

-   Sentiment analysis
-   Machine translation
-   Multilingual and multi-domain domain adaptation for NMT
-   Unsupervised language acquisition
-   Efficient algorithms for NLP
