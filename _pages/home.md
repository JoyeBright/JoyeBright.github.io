> I'm enthusiastically interested in Computer Science which its succinct definition is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. For me, It can be divided into two different aspects. In the first, working on academic scopes listed below and in the second one, server configuration and full-stack web development are my preferences.

My academic research interests include:
-   Natural Language Processing (NLP)
-   Sentiment Analysis
-   Deep Learning
-   Machine Learning
-   Data Mining
