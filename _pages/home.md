Hi there! I'm Javad Pourmostafa /'dʒævɒd puːr'moʊs'tae'fɑː/! I go by joeybright or joyebright, wherever I can get the username. I've published under the name 'Javad Pourmostafa Roshan Sharami.' Roshan Sharami is a suffix on my last name.

I'm a [Ph.D. candidate as well as a lecturer](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/j-pourmostafa){:target="new"} at the [Department of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence (CSAI)](https://csai.nl){:target="new"} of [Tilburg University](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/){:target="new"}, where I'm affiliated with the machine translation group ([ISMT](https://csai-ismt.github.io/){:target="new"}). My PhD thesis is titled "An NMT Framework based on Language Understanding." It is divided into two main parts: (i) will investigate neural machine translation for low-resource language, e.g., Persian, through cross-lingual knowledge transfer, and (ii) aims to delve into multilingual and multi-domain adaptation. My PhD supervisors are [Dr. Dimitar Shterionov](https://ilk.uvt.nl/~shterion/){:target="new"} and [Dr. Pieter Spronck](https://www.spronck.net/){:target="new"}.

Before joining Tilburg University, I was a postgraduate member of the [Guilan NLP Group](https://nlp.guilan.ac.ir){:target="new"} and a part-time lecturer at the Computer Engineering Department of the [University of Guilan](https://guilan.ac.ir/en/home){:target="new"}. I earned my BSc and MSc degrees in Software Engineering in 2016 and 2019, respectively. During my master's thesis, I designed sentiment analysis models using deep learning architectures for low-resource languages, with a focus on Persian. I was fortunate to work under the supervision of [Dr. Seyed Abolghasem Mirroshandel](https://guilan.ac.ir/en/~mirroshandel){:target="new"}.

My research mainly centralizes on natural language processing and deep learning. I'm also interested in AI more broadly.

Some topics of interest to me are:

-   Machine translation
-   Multilingual and multi-domain domain adaptation for NMT
-   Quality Estimation
-   Data Selection
-   Sentiment analysis

You're welcome to email me if you'd like to collaborate with me on the topics that intersect with NLP and DL.
