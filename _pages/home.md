> My full name is Javad PourMostafa and it is pronounced /dʒævɒd puːr moʊs tae fɑː/. I'm currently a graduate member at Guilan NLP Group and a part-time lecturer at the Computer Engineering Department of the University of Guilan. I graduated with an MS degree in Software Engineering from the same university in 2019. During the master thesis, I worked on designing sentiment analysis models using deep learning architectures for low-resources corpora. My research interests mainly centralize on Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning. However, as non-academic affairs, I spend my time on Unix-like servers maintenance.

My academic research interests include:
-   Natural Language Processing (NLP)
-   Sentiment Analysis, Opinion Mining
-   Deep Learning
-   Machine Learning
-   Data Mining
