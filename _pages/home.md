Hi there! I'm Javad Pourmostafa /'dʒævɒd puːr'moʊs'tae'fɑː/! I use the usernames "joeybright" or "joyebright" whenever available.

I'm a [Ph.D. candidate and lecturer](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/j-pourmostafa){:target="new"} at the [Department of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence (CSAI)](https://csai.nl){:target="new"} at [Tilburg University](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/){:target="new"}. My Ph.D. project focuses on domain-specific machine translation and quality estimation systems. I work with [Dr. Dimitar Shterionov](https://ilk.uvt.nl/~shterion/){:target="new"} and [Prof. Dr. Ir. Pieter Spronck](https://www.spronck.net/){:target="new"}.

Before joining Tilburg University, I was a postgraduate member of the [Guilan NLP Group](https://nlp.guilan.ac.ir){:target="new"} and a part-time lecturer at the Computer Engineering Department of the [University of Guilan](https://guilan.ac.ir/en/home){:target="new"}. I earned my BSc and MSc degrees in Software Engineering in 2016 and 2019, respectively. During my master's thesis, I designed sentiment analysis models using deep learning architectures for low-resource languages, with a focus on Persian. I was fortunate to work under the supervision of [Dr. Seyed Abolghasem Mirroshandel](https://guilan.ac.ir/en/~mirroshandel){:target="new"}.

My research mainly centralizes on natural language processing and deep learning.

Some topics of interest to me are:

- Machine Translation (MT)
- Multilingual and multi-domain domain adaptation for neural MT
- Quality Estimation
- Data Selection
- In-context Learning in LLMs for translation tasks
- Sentiment Analysis


Feel free to drop me a line if you'd like to collaborate with me on the topics that intersect with NLP and DL.
