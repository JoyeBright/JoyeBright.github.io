Hi, my full name is Javad PourMostafa (pronounced /'dʒævɒd puːr'moʊs'tae'fɑː/)! I go by joeybright or joyebright wherever I can get the username. 

I am currently a first-year PhD candidate at the [Department of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://csai.nl){:target="new"} of [Tilburg University](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/){:target="new"}. My PhD thesis, entitled "An NMT Framework based on Language Understanding". It is divided into two main parts: i) the first one will investigate into neural machine translation for low-resource language, e.g. Persian, through cross-lingual knowledge transfer, and (ii) the second one aims to delve into multilingual and multi-domain adaptation. My PhD supervisors are Dr. Dimitar Shterionov and Dr. Pieter Spronck.

Before joining Tilburg University, I was a postgraduate member at [Guilan NLP Group](https://nlp.guilan.ac.ir){:target="new"} and a part-time lecturer at the Computer Engineering Department of the [University of Guilan](https://guilan.ac.ir/en/home){:target="new"}. I graduated with an MS degree in Software Engineering from the same university in 2019. During the master thesis, I worked on designing sentiment analysis models using deep learning architectures for low-resources corpora (case-study: Persian). I was fortunate to work under supervision of Dr. Seyed Abolghasem Mirroshandel.

My research mainly centralizes on natural language processing and deep learning. I'm also interested in AI more broadly; as to non-academic affairs, I spend my time on Unix-like server maintenance. 

Some topics of interest to me are:

-   Sentiment analysis
-   Machine translation
-   Multilingual and multi-domain domain adaptation for NMT
-   Unsupervised language acquisition
-   Efficient algorithms for NLP
